Aug 31  · Public  · How do bees cope with disease? Bees live in packed hives, so any contagious disease could spread very fast and affect the whole colony. It helps that most bees only interact with bees of similar age that live in the same part of the hive (they start at the centre and progressively move to outdoor tasks as they get older). Bees also practice self (or forced) isolation, sick individuals remove themselves (or are excluded) from the colony.

They spend most of their time eating and resting, but also help cool the hive when the temperature rises, by flapping their wings. The drone’s main purpose is to procreate, and once they’ve mated with a queen they die. They play an essential role in ensuring that the colony is genetically diverse – giving it a greater chance of surviving. Find out how to protect our bees: http://ow.ly/Q58830r82Lv #BeeAwareMonth

The DENR said it has already launched an investigation on the reported fishkill but they have discounted the possibility that the incident was caused by the ongoing “beach nourishment project," noting that Baseco Compound was also hit by a fishkill incident in October last year due to decreased water oxygen level. | with reports from Elizabeth Marcelo

Seeing same thing at the state level with a systematic failure to provide the necessary resources for GA EPD to be able to do its job to protect the public. "Greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of global warming, which is increasingly causing damage throughout the United States. More frequent flooding along the coasts, increased fire hazard in the West, worsening air quality, and fiercer heat waves have all been tied to rising global temperatures. If emissions are not reined in, scientists say, the damage will only deepen."

Aug 24  · Public  · …Depots after inspections by the Environmental Protection Authority. There is still the old Blackheath tip to clean up (another million $$ plus, I am guessing) The Council is also part way through expenditure of $513,000 on the Enforceable Undertaking that it negotiated earlier this year with Safework in lieu of prosecution on eight counts. None of this is changed by the Ombudsman’s report. Cr Greenhill’s insistence that the Council "has been the victim of a politically motivated and prolonged attack" diminishes the role and achievements of Safework staff as well as the United Services Union and council workers. It was the Union that approached the Council executives and then Safework in May 2017 about Council’s asbestos management plan that was missing-in-action. According to the Ombudsmen, five months later the Union sent a formal complaint to Council, the '166 Letter', with 166 points of concern. This became Safework’s primary investigation guide. It is up to the Public Inquiry to find out why the Union and workers needed to do this and to then go to the Gazette and later 2GB when there was still no sign of the asbestos management plan and more operational safety issues had surfaced. The Ombudsman’s report does not address that matter. The Public Inquiry starts again on 28 September. Council recently won an award for the implementation of its transformational Performance improvement Order (PIO) imposed by the former Minister of Local Government. It is worth recalling that the Minister’s PIO was based on the recommendations of the investigators commissioned by Council’s lawyers in response to Ray Hadley’s interviews with Acting General Secretary of the Union Steve Donnelly on 8th and 9th November 2017. Rather than complain about political victimhood, perhaps it is time to acknowledge that the fourth estate played an essential role along with the workers, the Union, and Safework. As a result the Council is a cleaner and safer workplace. https://www.bluemountainsgazette.com.au/story/6889937/ombudsman-recommends-safework-apologise-to-blue-mountains-council-and-pay-compensation-over-handling-of-asbestos-compliance/?cs=1432
