And he's absolutely right. Unlike the vast majority of economic visions that endorse #profitsoverplanet, a #steadystateeconomy explicitly prioritizes environmental protection and ecological sustainability.

China's democratic structures provide ample space for Chinese activists to improve life/society. Want to improve worker protections, environmental protection, science, collective decision-making, equality, treatment of minorities? You can do that work. No need to be a 'dissident'

The GOP of Dwight D. Eisenhower was indeed a force for good in America. In his farewell address he spoke of environmental protection, cooperation between the parties and warned us the Military, Industrial Complex could take over. He was right; JFK was murdered & they took over.

They become less dependent on religion—and less willing to accept its constraints, including keeping women in the kitchen and gay people in the closet—as existential insecurity diminished and life expectancy rose.
