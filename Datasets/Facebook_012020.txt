22. IMF has raised concerns over our government's data reporting norms, delays, India's tax revenue estimates and GDP growth targets. Such data cook-ups amount to setting new precedents to any party who might rule us in the future.

23. India has witnessed sheer exploitation of power and criminalization of politics in:
-Ex BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar's case

-Malegaon blast terror accused Pragya Thakur became BJP MP and was on parliamentary defense panel.
-DSP Devindar Singh's case is of no hope for obvious reasons.
-Electoral bonds and anonymity of funding. Incidentally, BJP had received donation of 10 crores from a firm 'RKW developers ltd' that was being probed for terror funding by ED. (Source: BJP's declaration in their EC filing.)

24. Election commission is completely compromised. Data discrepancy(347 seats) in 2019 LS polls and Election commissioner Ashok Lavasa & family getting grilled by ED thereafter.

26. On 20th 2019 March United Nations released new 2019 rankings for World Happiness Index 🇺🇳 
India's drastic fall under Modi continues.. 
2013 - Rank 117 
2016 - Rank 118
2017 - Rank 122
2018 - Rank 133
2019 - Rank 140
Out of total 153 countries. 
Happiness is ranked based on 6 variables -
- GDP per Capita
- Healthy Life Expectancy 
- Freedom to make life choices 
- Social support
- Generosity
- Perception of Corruption 
Therefore, for the common man in India, things have been becoming worse in all these points. Pakistan is ranked much higher than us at 67. If the current rate continues, we will probably become World's worst country in this regard before 2022. That is when Modi says #NewIndia will be achieved.
[ https://www.business-standard.com/article/politics/pm-modi-calls-for-new-india-free-of-caste-corruption-top-10-developments-118022600221_1.html
 https://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/if-modi-wins-again-this-could-be-his-plan-for-india75/articleshow/67178619.cms

theprint.in/opinion/40-things-modi-has-promised-to-achieve-by-2022/268293/%3famp ]

These are some of the points, leave aside, the effects of Demonetization, GST, Cleaning Ganga, Rafale Scam aside. More Importantly, the country's harmony has been wrecked. If you speak anything against PM or the government, you are either Pakistani or Anti-National. 
The worst governance, India has ever had in the last 70 years. Period.
