I'm not your enemy. For some of you, I'm family. I'm not threatening your freedom by supporting common sense gun laws, COVID masks, separation of church/state, public schools, fair pay for workers, environmental protection, etc. I want you to have a prosperous life, too.

 are all using #Covid19 as an excuse to get rid of environmental protection. This is the kind of criminal behaviour politicians get away with under FPtP. #ClimateCriminal #ProRep #Cdnpoli #Onpoli #ABpoli

Blast destroys one of country's oldest known Aboriginal heritage sites
Rio Tinto funded a salvage mission at two rock shelters to safeguard any artefacts, but the dig turned up finds whose significance exceeded all expectations.

That is quite simply inexcusable.  Australia's environmental protection legislation is weak and routinely ignored.  If the Franklin Dam were to be proposed today it would have sailed through :(

Speaking of transparency... do you work for the AMA or the NDP? It's not clear.

 Citizens actually care deeply about health care in Alberta. They also care about K-12 publicly funded education, post-sec ed, social services, environmental protection, diversification of industry, etc. The argument that everyone works for the NDP or AMA is tiresome.

The beach is clean again, at least for a moment. Thank you to all the environmental stewards out there; paid and unpaid. #Sydney #coast #marinedebris #shippingaccidents #marinepollution #plasticpollution

From cutting off aid to Albertans he/the UCP/the CPC/the IDU consider liabilities (i.e. not contributing to corporate coffers) & justifying letting some of these people die to restoke the capitalist money machine, to paving the way for private education and health care 4/7

I expect Jason's real bosses are fairly pleased with his progress. He is the steam roller and Albertans are the pavement. In another couple of years, there will be no universal health care, no harm reduction, no environmental protection... 5/7

And: it's crucial that the #SDGs are above partisanship in Canada. They were affirmed in Sept 2015 by 
@stephenharper
's Conservative government and since pursued by 
@JustinTrudeau
's Liberal government. The political debate can rightly be over HOW to achieve #togetherensemble2020

Absolutely, one of my favourite parts about the #SDGs is regardless of your entry point (whether that be social issues, environmental protection, or a strong economy) it unifies us in a big picture vision! #TogetherEnsemble2020

China has made key progress in its critical battle against pollution, with further reductions in the discharge of major pollutants and overall improvements in the environment. Seven of nine binding targets in environmental protection were met ahead of schedule and were surpassed.

I see Brexiters want a deregulated tax haven in the middle of England. Where do they think those who go there will come from? And why? And what happens to the places they leave behind? And the people left there? And the public services they will defund?

and who is going to clean their streets, hospital? Who will be working in their restaurants with low pay? How are they going to enforce food standards or environmental protection like clean air/water?.......
