'Earth day is being celebrated every year on April 22nd since 1970. It's aim is to demonstrate support for environment protection. ☘️

Soon after first celebration, clean air act, clean water act and the endangered species act were passed by the USA. Paris agreement was also passed on same occasion in 2015.
Having regard to this agreement,  the theme of earth day 2020 is CLIMATE ACTION. As climate change is the biggest risk to the following decade. Even an increase of 0.5° can be life threatening. This clearly indicates that actions must be taken by each and every individual to protect Mother Earth in every plausible way. 

Despondently, during this pandemic period, we can't gather and celebrate physically by running campaigns, organising competitions and awareness programmes. We may be apart, but through the power of digital media, we’re also more connected than ever. Let's set an example for generations by gathering virtually and emerging as an unforgettable strength.

So join the global digital mobilization by seizing all the tools and actions that we have, big and small, to change our lives and change our world towards a better and healthier planet, not for today, but forever. 🌏'
