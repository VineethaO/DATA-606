While the folks on Wall Street are giddily cheering the success of NASDAQ, remember:

- people still can't afford Healthcare
- farmers are still going broke
- national debt still at $23T
- our salaries still suck
- we still have a criminal in the WH stuffing his own pockets

The Trump administration shut down the TOXMAP interactive pollution map that allowed the public to see the results of their environmental protection rollbacks. Because what you don't know can't give your children tumors?

Welcome to my feed. 
That is FALSE 

Republicans got ALL of their witnesses with any knowledge of WHY Trump blocked aid, which is why he was impeached. None of them said he didn't do it.
