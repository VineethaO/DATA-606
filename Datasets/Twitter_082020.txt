Trump's politicised Environmental Protection Agency approved disinfectant SurfaceWise2 for use on 
@AmericanAir
 planes claiming without evidence that it kills coronavirus on surfaces "for up to a week". Passengers to be guinea pigs to see what happens.
Chemical experts question EPA’s approval of coronavirus disinfectant
The Environmental Protection Agency's decision to allow the use of a powerful disinfectant by American Airlines and two Texas sports clinics is facing criticism.
