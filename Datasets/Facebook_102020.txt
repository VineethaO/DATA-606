Michael Platt to Florida, See it like a Native
Oct 12 ·  · …part of Florida's Department of Environmental Protection. The first claim under the Homestead Act was made by Daniel Freeman Daniel Freeman (1826–1908) was an American homesteader, physician and Civil War veteran. He was the first person to file for a claim under…
'Laying Claim to the Land: Homesteads

Florida was one of 30 states formed from the “public domain” land that was owned by the federal government and transferred to individuals under Congressional laws such as the Armed Occupation Act of 1842 following the Second Seminole War, and the similar but more successful Homestead Act of 1862.

Generally, the Homestead Act gave any head of family or person over 21 who was a citizen (or intending to become one) 160 acres of land, free of charge, if they built a home on the land, cultivated it, and resided there for five years. Later acts amended the original one; for example, in 1880 it was extended to include both surveyed and unsurveyed land.

Many early settlers purchased their land from the State of Florida, through the Internal Improvement Trust Fund (IITF) created in 1855. The trustees of the IITF managed state land received from the federal government. 

The “improvements” it arranged eventually included Flagler’s Florida East Coast Railway, the East Coast Canal (Intracoastal Waterway), and drainage of the Everglades. The Internal Improvement Fund still exists as part of Florida's Department of Environmental Protection.

The first claim under the Homestead Act was made by Daniel Freeman Daniel Freeman (1826–1908) was an American homesteader, physician and Civil War veteran. He was the first person to file for a claim under Homestead Act of 1862. He was also the plaintiff in a landmark separation of church and state decision.'
