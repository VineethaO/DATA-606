'My advocacy for women and children protection is the approach of society in obtaining the efficacy of a sustainable environment wherein women are recognize and given chances to showcase their capacities to take actions to whatever the needs of social growth and development, :The rights of Women and Children should always be respected at all times regardless of race, colour  and religious affiliations. Women should be treated as equal human beings with compassion,love, value and respect. With this, programs and advocacies as implemented it invokes the rights of every women and children against all forms of abuses, discrimination and oppression. It educates and empowers women being confident and never fading strength to pursue her dreams and ambition in any aspect of society as equal contributors and part of the society.

The New Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 draft proposed by the Union government favors large industries, neglecting the balance between sustainable development and environment protection.
An attempt to weaken environmental regulation and silence all affected communities.

Loopholes and changes made in the EIA new draft 2020 compared to the EIA of 2006.

1)  The EIA 2020 draft allows post-facto clearance, which defines if a project has established without environment clearances, industries are allowed to resume operations under the provision of the EIA 2020 draft.

2) The EIA 2020 draft deprives the privilege of communities, providing no authority over participation, thereby abandoning public trust in raising their concerns on disagreements. 

3) The EIA 2020 draft weakens the rights of all communities by legalizing projects that have caused a great deal of harm to the environment by prolonging the operations carried out by industries without any approvals provided by EIA.

4) The authorities earlier mandated to monitor projects within environmental norms for every six months, now relaxed to a frequency of once a year only.

Suggestion to modify the new EIA 2020 draft 

1) No development activity to be encouraged in wildlife protected areas as 97% region of our country is already exploited for human use that leaves us with only 3% of the protected forest area in India. While a large number of rivers that provide fresh water flows at only 3% of these protected areas raises an alarm of human survival and wildlife. 

2) The post-facto clearance for industries should completely be banned, a project without EIA clearance to be suspended immediate effect. 

3) The rights should be extended to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) team to review the impact of the project before commencing and analyze the overall risks.

4)  A timeline of 2-3 months to determine the conclusion for any project to get underway. 

5) The border area's definition of aerial distance from neighboring countries to be declined at just 25-40km from 100km radius. 

6) All projects designed for public spaces, public opinion, or environmental experts' opinions to be taken into consideration before commencing any project.

1. I will plant at least five trees or saplings in my house or in my neighbourhood and nurture them.
