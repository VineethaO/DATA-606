Or the UCP. Or the Saskatchewan Party. Or the Ontario PCs, or the Manitoba PCs. You cannot separate the bits you like from what the party is as a whole. It's a package deal, folks. You want a tiny bit of it so you vote for it? Guess what? You voted for ALL of it. 3/6

You voted for defunding health care and education. You voted for rolling back minimum wages and workplace health and safety. You voted for reducing environmental protection. You voted for racist speechwriters and unaccountable war rooms. 4/6

You are awesome, Sen Markey. I hope to help you get reelected. Thank you for your work on environmental protection, chemical policy reform and for me, most importantly, your advocacy for more research funding for MECFS.

Long past time for NI to have an independent environmental protection agency. 
Like the one promised in the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal which restored the NI Executive in January.
