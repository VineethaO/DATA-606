Hopefully, Michael Moore's #PlanetoftheHumans will go down as the last wheezing gasp of climate denialism. It's a sad turn for Moore's career. Read @KetanJ0's dismemberment of the film and its sources. It's a thing of beauty. #ClimateChange twitter.com/KetanJ0/status…

An EIA is an important tool to achieve sustainability. Diluting it the way it has been done in the new draft by the MoEFCC will only serve violators and weaken existing laws that regulate environmental protection norms of this country.  #SaveEIA #EIAForGreenIndia
