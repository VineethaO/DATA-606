It is false equivalence when you try to draw a nexus between the Niger Delta militancy; based solely on an environmental protection advocacy which Saro-Wiwa started & died for, and Boko Haram that is a part of a global terrorist network.

I see this as if Bloomberg gets the nomination then the Democrats ideologically become the old Republicans, a new liberal party would rise after this year to become the old Democrats, and the Trump Republican party will continue it's transition to the American Nazi party.

On this day in 1919, Congress established the Grand Canyon National Park. 

In 1928, a young Richard Nixon visited the Grand Canyon with friends from Whittier High School.

Perhaps this visit to one of the natural wonders of the world spurred RN’s lifelong passion for the preservation of nature, culminating in his Legacy of Parks initiative and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970.

So this post is addressing a system of thought that has been in place even before we hit the biodiversity emergency that we are in now. Many habitats and species do need to be protected but it's not because humans aren't a part of nature, it's because we're in an emergency.

And what we have to make sure of in addressing this emergency is that we are not compromising the livelihood of indigenous people in our environmental protection efforts.

The Law of Diminshing Returns applies nicely to regulations. 

With each new regulation, you may get an incremental increase in e.g. environmental protection, but only to a point. 

After the point, the regulation only adds cost and time, because no return is seen.

Under President Trump, EPA has finalized 51 deregulatory actions, saving Americans and estimated $6.5 billion dollars in regulatory costs. We have an additional 45 actions in development projected to save billions more.

Sounds like you're proud that as an agency you're no longer working to protect the environment. Doesn't that strike you as odd? 
You're the Environmental Protection Agency - you have a job to do!
