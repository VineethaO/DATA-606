Vulnerable communities face larger threats under EPA‚Äôs proposed science rule

In science, transparency is typically considered a virtue. But a rule proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, titled "Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science," is getting pushback from the scientific community.
An EPA rule may restrict science used for public health regulations
Editors of six major scientific journals argue that a rule proposed by the U.S. EPA may keep key data from factoring into environmental regulations.
