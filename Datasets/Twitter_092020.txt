Speaking of demands, how about tax returns, a DNA sample, a comprehensive health care plan, an environmental protection plan, a plan to deal with #COVITRUMP19 & a break up with lover Putin?

Environmental protection and stewardship

An economy underpinned by environmental sustainability

A genuine attempt to prevent dangerous climate change

A taxation system that *does* give everyone a *fair go*

A government that's not blatantly corrupt 

A free and fearless MSM

US industry was critical of the call for environmental protection, citing the "tremendous costs involved.”

Five decades of predatory delay.

Sorry, 
@SteveDaines
, but you've taken over $1 million from fossil fuel corporations. How does that protect our way of life? 

You decry every environmental protection. Are you saying that a polluted MT is our way of life? It's confusing.

If they get their way Welcome to the new Gilded Age. Rich reap all the benefits, they'll own the courts/government. Minority rights(POC, Women, LGBTQ, etc)gone. Middle class almost gone, workers rights, unions, collective bargaining, health/safety/environmental protection gone

No, the deep and abiding interest is in Chevron v NRDC, not Roe. There is no money to be made from Roe.

Completely agree. This is about taking away the government’s ability to regulate economic activity - including environmental protection, workplace safety, labor rights, financial activity, & health insurance - under the guise of taking away women’s rights & reproductive freedom.

I am thrilled to hear that modernizing CEPA is still on the agenda! Canadian Environmental Protection Act is long in need of an update. Thanks for your unrelenting efforts

$8 million has been awarded to support conservation around Sebago Lake, which provides drinking water to one-sixth of Maine’s population and is a major draw for outdoor recreationalists. This investment will help preserve this pristine natural resource.

Sure, let's trust Susan Collins with environmental protection money after Trump has abolished so many of the existing EPA programs.

Sure, that makes sense!

How much will Maine get and how much to Trump?
