'Join the Movement for Environment Protection 

My love for the environment and nature is unique and evergreen. I have promised myself that no matter what the situation, I will continue to do tree plantation and other work for the environment till my last breath. But from my vast experience in this field, it has become 
very clear to me that in the last decades we have degraded the environment and nature to a great extent. It will take a few more years to rectify the damage we have inflicted. And its not the sole responsibility of an individual or Ngos but rather on every human being on this planet to care for Mother Nature.

In order to do something concrete and result oriented work in the field of environment, many people will have to engage themselves towards this cause. Only then will we be able to realize our dreams of a pollution free green planet. Although often some people tell me that despite their unique desire to work for the environment or nature, they cannot contribute due to several reasons.

However I always tell them that if you want to do something for the environment it is not necessary to contribute with physical presence or technical knowledge only. I would suggest everyone to work for the environment with the skills that you have.

If your writing skills are good, you can help the environment with your content. Or if you are  good at photography or video editing, you can do your bit for nature through your abilities. After all with your art or skills only, you can give a certain status to the work of Nature or Environment. As a result  hundreds of other people can join this Movement.

Apart from this you can also contribute as a volunteer. Your small steps can make a big difference to the world's environment. The time has really come that the community at large will have to undertake this mission. Because if only a few individuals or organizations work in this direction,our goal will not be accomplished.  And yes, if you want to join me, I welcome you with open arms. I would be very proud to say 'give me your skills and I will give you a pollution free green globe.'

I don't think this is a bad deal. What do you believe?'

'My advocacy for women and children protection is the approach of society in obtaining the efficacy of a sustainable environment wherein women are recognize and given chances to showcase their capacities to take actions to whatever the needs of social growth and development, :The rights of Women and Children should always be respected at all times regardless of race, colour  and religious affiliations. Women should be treated as equal human beings with compassion,love, value and respect. With this, programs and advocacies as implemented it invokes the rights of every women and children against all forms of abuses, discrimination and oppression.

'*ENVIRONMENT LAW REVIEW*
An interim report – released today – into a review of the Federal Environment Protection and Biosecurity Conservation Act has found it to be ineffective, not fit for purpose, and not trusted by stakeholders. 
I look forward to reading this review carefully and making sure its draft recommendations are appropriate for Northern Australia.
It's particularly pleasing to see a strong leaning towards streamlining the environmental approvals process, granting more certainty around threatened species classifications, getting rid of duplications with State laws, and moving from a process-driven system to an outcomes-based one.
I would like to thank the many people who made submissions to the review and I’m confident any changes will have wide support.

Petition URL: https://bit.ly/2ZAAnfh

The New Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 draft proposed by the Union government favors large industries, neglecting the balance between sustainable development and environment protection.
An attempt to weaken environmental regulation and silence all affected communities.

Loopholes and changes made in the EIA new draft 2020 compared to the EIA of 2006.

1)  The EIA 2020 draft allows post-facto clearance, which defines if a project has established without environment clearances, industries are allowed to resume operations under the provision of the EIA 2020 draft.

2) The EIA 2020 draft deprives the privilege of communities, providing no authority over participation, thereby abandoning public trust in raising their concerns on disagreements. 

3) The EIA 2020 draft weakens the rights of all communities by legalizing projects that have caused a great deal of harm to the environment by prolonging the operations carried out by industries without any approvals provided by EIA.

4) The authorities earlier mandated to monitor projects within environmental norms for every six months, now relaxed to a frequency of once a year only.

Suggestion to modify the new EIA 2020 draft 

1) No development activity to be encouraged in wildlife protected areas as 97% region of our country is already exploited for human use that leaves us with only 3% of the protected forest area in India. While a large number of rivers that provide fresh water flows at only 3% of these protected areas raises an alarm of human survival and wildlife. 

2) The post-facto clearance for industries should completely be banned, a project without EIA clearance to be suspended immediate effect. 

3) The rights should be extended to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) team to review the impact of the project before commencing and analyze the overall risks.

4)  A timeline of 2-3 months to determine the conclusion for any project to get underway. 

5) The border area's definition of aerial distance from neighboring countries to be declined at just 25-40km from 100km radius. 

6) All projects designed for public spaces, public opinion, or environmental experts' opinions to be taken into consideration before commencing any project.

IT IS TIME TO RAISE OUR VOICE.'
